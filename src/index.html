  My name is Steve. I work at iPorta Corp creating solutions to challenging problems.
  Over the last few years javascript has caught my attention and I have been honing my skills working with es2015/2016 and node.js along with various popular frameworks.

  Aside from writing code I often spend my free time tinkering with game development, photography, music and filmmaking.
